            An exploratory project, with the aim of applying the Monte Carlo Tree Search
            algorithm (MCTS) to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe for varying board sizes.
            This solves the game making it impossible to beat!

            If you're interested, you can find the code for this project

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe can be solved by applying a simple minimax algorithm,
            however in this project we take a different approach by applying the Monte Carlo Tree
            Search algorithm (MCTS).

            Simpler approaches such as a classic minimax algorithm can also be used (i.e. one
            player tries to maximise the outcome with the other player trying to minimize the outcome),
            however MCTS removes the reliance on an evaluation function 
            by continously simulating random actions from game states and backpropagating those
            results up the search tree over a large number of iterations. Following this, we can then
            select the most promising action to take from a given state.

            however for games with larger branching factors, for example Chess or Go,

            John Levine provides a brilliant explanation of MCTS, which you can find

            and was the main source of inspiration for this project.
